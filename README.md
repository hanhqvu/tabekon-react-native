# TabeKon

In the current iteration, Tabekon is an app to help user find inspiration on foods to make/order. This is inspired by the choice paralysis I and my friends often face when deciding what to eat. For the next iteration, I'm intending to turn Tabekon into a sharing platform so users can share what they ate, where did they eat it or how did they make it. I'm currently still working on this iteration so please be patient!
